ROMA is one of the data storing systems for distributed key-value
stores. It is a completely decentralized distributed system that
consists of multiple processes, called nodes, on several machines. It
is based on pure P2P architecture like a distributed hash table, thus
it provides high availability and scalability.

ROMA is written in Ruby. However, following choices are available to
access to ROMA.

* Client libraries of Ruby and Java are available.
* ROMA protocol is compatible with memcached text-based one so that 
  any memcached client libraries allows users to interact with ROMA.
